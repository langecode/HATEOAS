/**
 * this implements the sorting API capability which follows the
 * structure like {@literal(sort="<attribute>::+/-|<attribute>::+/-|...)}
 * and the default is {@literal(sort="<attribute>|<attribute>|...)}
 * which means default is ascending.
 * so <code>sort="balance|lastUpdate"</code> would mean ascending in relation
 * to balance and if equal then according to lastUpdate.
 * <p>
 * The <code>sort</code> APi capability is handled by the Sort class and this is a simplistic way to get the
 * QueryParam mapped to a List with a unique representation of the attributes to cort by.
 * The responsibility for having a Map is that every <code>attribute</code> used to specify sorting can
 * only be present once as the same attribute with multiple representations and thus directions does
 * not make sense, the Map allows only one key and having the attribute (stems from the json and thus the representation)
 * as key helps to enforce that.
 * <p>
 * In this case the mapping between the Sort API capability, which is an integral part of the exposure is
 * mapped straight to a corresponding internal model. That is the attribute naming is here expected to be
 * the same for the exposure and representation and onto the model. That will not always be the case and thus
 * the Sort Capability must be extended for these cases and that will enable the a variable mapping from the
 * representation and on to the model.
 * <p>
 * The reponsibility for the mapping is chosen to be done in this layer as an extension in order to avoid having the
 * Model "infected" with mapping to and from the representations. Another choice could have been to let the
 * representation(s) do that and that would have concrete model class persistable field knowledge in the representation(s)
 * which is not desirable and thus the choice was to let the Sort class take that responsibility and thus extensions can handle
 * necessary translations or mappings between the exposure and representations from and to the model.
